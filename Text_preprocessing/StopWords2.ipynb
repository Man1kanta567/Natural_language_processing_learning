    "Today, I am honoured to speak about one of India's most revered figures, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, fondly known as the \"Missile Man of India\" and the \"People's President.\" His life is a testament to dedication, perseverance, and the power of dreams.\n",
    "Dr. Kalam was born in 1931 in a small town called Rameswaram. He hailed from a humble background but was driven by a passion for science and technology. His academic journey was marked by determination, as he worked tirelessly to overcome challenges and become a key figure in India's space and defence programs. As an aerospace scientist, he played a pivotal role in the development of India's missile systems, including the Agni and Prithvi missiles.\n",
    "In 2002, Dr. Kalam became the 11th President of India, a position he used to inspire millions of young minds across the country. His vision for India’s future was based on empowering youth and fostering innovation. He always emphasised that \"Dream, Dream, Dream\" because dreams shape the future. His love for children and his belief in their potential made him an extraordinary leader who was always accessible to the people.\n",
    "Even after his presidency, Dr. Kalam continued to contribute to society through his lectures, books, and interactions with students, always urging them to follow their passion and make a positive impact on the world.\n",
    "Dr. Kalam’s life reminds us that with hard work, determination, and a vision, we can achieve greatness, no matter where we come from. His legacy continues to inspire not only India but the entire world.\n",
